### What is this area for?
This area is free for you to write and store __PHP/SQL__ code
It is accessible to tutors so you are able to seek help if your designs are not working

You are recommended to create suitable file structures for any work here i.e.
folders for...
- php
- html
- js
- images
- css

All tests need to be from an index file (either index.html or inder.php) as the server will only look for this file name.

You can use the __test PHP__ shortcut menu bar link to run files

Note: do not run as anything other than Box URL if you want PHP to run.

#### It is not for assignment work
